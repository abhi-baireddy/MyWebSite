Human beings have this amazing ability to think which leads to all kinds of problems. I identify myself as a human being and I have reasonable evidence to believe that I am capable of thinking. But of what use are thoughts if they are not developed and shared? 

This is where I will write about some random thoughts that usually come to me when I am taking a dump (gross!) or when I am cooking or whenever I am not consciously thinking about something (does that even make sense).

What I write here might seem completely stupid or well thought out depending on who you are. I have to say they will sound stupid most of the time. If you are a recruiter looking at my website, please don't read further.
