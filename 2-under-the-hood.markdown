At the time of Richard Feynman's death, his black board had this quote written on it: "What I cannot create, I do not understand". The coverse of this statement is also true: "What I cannot understand, I cannot create". To quote the man, "If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it".

Posts under this section are an attempt to prove to myself that I really understood something. I will pick a topic that is considered "common sense" by people who study Computer Science but sounds esoteric to a computer-owning layman. I will dumb down the technicalities of the concept and put it in simple words that could be understood by anybody who can read English and think for sometime.
