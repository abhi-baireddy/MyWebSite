Thanks for stopping by! I am Abhi Baireddy, a grad student at [Utah SoC](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). I am still figuring out on what kind of job I would take once I graduate but it will be mostly something like software developer engineer. I have no area of focus per se but I am basically interested in writing code that runs beautiful things. 

I am currently looking for Summer 2020 internship opportunities. I have no kind of work experience in the industry as I chose to pursue Master's immediately after I got my bachelor's. 

This is my website where I write about things I have learnt or things that interest me.
